## About this repository
This project displays five pictures in evenly spaced columns. Each column is divided into thirds with a word centered in each. The top and bottom word are not visible until the column is clicked. When the column is clicked:
- the size of the column expands horizontally relative to the other columns.
- the font size of the word in the center of the column doubles in size.
- the top and bottom words enter the screen from top and bottom respectively after the column's width has finished growing.

This project is built with code and guidance from Wes Bos and Javascript30.com.
